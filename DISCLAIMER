To test this image, first run the container with

'docker run --rmdp 2222:2222 --name jail oldjamey/dockerjail:latest'

and pull the private key from the container using

'docker cp jail:/home/alpine/id_rsa dockerjail.pem'

Run 'chmod 600 dockerjail.pem' to make sure permissions are secure (enough).
Then 'ssh -i dockerjail.pem -p 2222 alpine@localhost' to SSH into the container.

Pulling this public Docker image is pretty insecure because you will be sharing a
private key with anyone running the same version, so your container at least could get
pretty easily compromised.

Without the iptables implementation on the host, this is mainly just an insecure container
running sshd as a non-root user, and it is at the mercy of the host's password weakness.

For this reason, I would urge you to clone the GitHub repo from https://github.com/phx/dockerjail.git
and build the container yourself by running the install.sh script, which has a lot of bells and whistles
to secure your container and lock it down to only be able to access the host.

Not to mention having your own privately-generated ssh keypair ;)
